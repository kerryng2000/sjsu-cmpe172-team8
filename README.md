- Project Introduction (what the application does)


- In college, many people commute to school, especially universities such as San Jose State University. Many will commute to the campus and find out that there isn’t a parking spot for their car and waste time and gas to drive around the campus looking for a spot. Some would choose to go to the university parking lot, however, those are also full too during times where there are many classes in session. Our application aims to solve this problem, where users are able to sell their spots to other students. Users can list their parking spot available and when it’s bought, the other user can take the spot without the stress of looking for another spot.

- Instructions on how to run the project locally.
- To run the app,  Enter command npm install. In a second terminal cd to backend, then enter the command npm install. Go in to each component in the src folder and change the web addresses to localhost:5000 to have the backend and frontend connect locally. Once the packages have finish installation, in the first terminal cd to src, then enter the command npm start and in the backend/2nd terminal also enter npm start. This will open up a browser which will display our application.
