- Project Introduction (what the application does)


- In college, many people commute to school, especially universities such as San Jose State University. Many will commute to the campus and find out that there isn’t a parking spot for their car and waste time and gas to drive around the campus looking for a spot. Some would choose to go to the university parking lot, however, those are also full too during times where there are many classes in session. Our application aims to solve this problem, where users are able to sell their spots to other students. Users can list their parking spot available and when it’s bought, the other user can take the spot without the stress of looking for another spot.

- To run the app, first cd to my-react-app. Enter command npm install. In a second terminal cd to my-react-app and then cd to backend, then enter the command npm install. Once the packages have finish installation, in the first terminal cd to src, then enter the command npm start and in the backend/2nd terminal also enter npm start.
